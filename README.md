Welcome to React Paint!

This react web app is inspired by MS paint. After you pull, don't forget to run npm i to install packages.
Once the packages are installed, you can:

- Click on the pencil icon to colour individual squares (note the default colour is grey)
- Change the colour using the colour picker
- Fill consecutive groups of like squares by clicking on the paint bucket icon
- Change the canvas size by clicking on the fullscreen icon
- Delete your drawing by clicking the trash icon

NOTE: webapp was tested on a desktop computer in Chrome. The webapp is not guarnteed to work in any other web browser or on a mobile device. Was developed using vs code.

Here are some libraries/code/free icons I made use of
